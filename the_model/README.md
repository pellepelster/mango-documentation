# The Model

This chapter describes the model that builds the foundation for all Mango projects. The model is text based (backed by [Xtext](https://www.xtext.org)) and therefore comes with all amenities of the Eclipse IDE (synatax highlighting, auto-complete, outline view, ...). The model provides facilities to create entities, generic CRUD interfaces for these entities as well as services (REST, SOAP).
