# Properties

Mango includes everything needed to equip your application with configuration options that can be given from the command line using Java system properties, Spring properties or stored in the database.
The properties are defined using a Java based DSL and support features like fallback to other properties if property is undefined, default vales and a web interface to change properties in the frontend.
There are three sources of property values the database, Java system properties (-D parameter) of Spring properties. The Mango property builder lets you define properties for one of this three sources and dar√ºberhinaus supports the definiion of fallback and default values.

** simple string property stored inside the database **
```
IProperty<String> DB_PROPERTY = PropertyBuilder.createStringProperty("dbproperty").database();

IPropertyService propertyService = [...];

// set the value
propertyService.setProperty(DB_PROPERTY, "my property");

// retrieve the previously set value
String dbproperty = propertyService.getProperty(DB_PROPERTY);

```
